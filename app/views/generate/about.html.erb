        <p class="lead">I worked on this project during my time in the <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/front-end-web-development/san-francisco">Front-End Web Development</a> program at <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a> in San Francisco. I chose to work on this as my final project in order to have a project that could be used by the general public, to make use of JavaScript for more than just presentational magic, and to craft a site that embraced a front-end only philosophy.</p>

        <p class="lead">Orignally, I came up with the idea to create this project after reading a Hacker News <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3751295">post</a> about the MLA presenting a new standard for citing a Tweet. I saw this development, as a perfect starting point for a simple web application, that when created would be useful for students, academics, and journalists; I immediately created a specification of how the final product would work. That's when the fun started.</p>

        <p class="lead">During the project I encountered various problems, including Twitter changing how its API could be accessed; because of the problems I encountered, the Tweet2Cite project morphed into being a bookmarklet, and then coming full circle, back to being a web application. Throughout the project, I came to understand that web development is often an exercise in 2 steps forward 1 step back, take your jacket off and hack. I learned a lot with this project and look forward to expanding on the lessons I've learned from it.</p>
